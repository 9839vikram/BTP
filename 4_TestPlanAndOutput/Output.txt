We’ve gone through the basics of NOMA and seen how it outperforms traditional 
OFDMA in terms of Sum Capacity, Energy Efficiency, and Spectral Efficiency. We’ve
also spoken about how imperfection at the SIC receiver affects device efficiency.
NOMA remains the best choice for potential 5G networks due to its unique features.
Figures 6.4 and 6.5 depict the system’s outage probability vs SNR for two and
three users, respectively. The simulated and empirical values derived from outage
Probability expressions are nearly identical.It’s also observed that at high SNR, the
outage Probability curve reaches the asymptotic floor. It can also be shown that as
the value of βu1r increases, the value of this asymptotic floor decreases monotonically.
The outage Probability of two users versus SNR for HD/FD NOMA is plotted in
Figure 6.8. In the presence of low SNR, the outage output of FD NOMA outperforms
that of HD NOMA. This is due to the fact that LI is not a significant impact factor
for FD NOMA in the low SNR region. In the high SNR region, the asymptotic
curves closely resemble the exact performance curves. It is demonstrated that error
floors occur in FD NOMA and that zero diversity order can be obtained. This is due
to the fact that in FD NOMA, there is loop interference. In the high SNR region,
the HD NOMA outperforms the FD NOMA.
